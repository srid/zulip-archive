We can also probably agree that the world would be a better place if Haskells becomes more popular.</p>
<p>But Haskell is currently #41 per the TIOBE Index:<br>
<a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" title="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/</a></p>
<p>It is ranking below languages like Rust (#27), Scala (#28), LISP (#32), and F# (#33). </p>
<p>The rank alone doesn't tell the full story, and the TIOBE index may not be the best indicator for language adoption (this is for another discussion), but clearly it would be worthwhile to actively invest in growing our community.</p>
<p>It is especially challenging in the case of Haskell (e.g. as opposed to Rust) because many programmers have never heard of Haskell, and many will probably find the learning curve steeper than that of widely used languages. Learning Haskell is more intimidating than learning Rust, for example, and I think this is a major factor affecting Haskell adoption.</p>
<p>I know the Haskell community has probably discussed this before but I think it's worth discussing in a dedicated video session if there is enough interest. </p>
<p>Proposed discussion points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current state of Haskell adoption</li>
<li>Past and current organized dedicated efforts to grow the Haskell community</li>
<li>How can we contribute to pre-existing community growth efforts?</li>
<li>Discussing ideas for new dedicated community growth initiatives</li>
</ul>
<p>The current quarantine situation is the reason I started thinking about this topic. I noticed Haskell meetups shifting to online streaming. ZuriHac2020 will be held online. Our video chat sessions here also started due to the quarantine. Personally, I found learning Haskell to be more enjoyable and less intimidating thanks to these new changes, and this made me wonder if this increased level of community interaction can be maintained in the future, and how helpful it would be to the growth of the Haskell community going forwards.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm up for discussing these points in a video chat session if anyone else is interested. Feel free to suggest the ideal date/time for the chat + any additional points for discussion about this topic</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/31b0847ae161d8af30e1a2fcb059be4d?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Hazem</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195303963" name="195303963"><div>2020-04-25 21:35:48</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>Update: We discussed this after today's General chat and it was very informative.

<p>There were comments made about the success of languages like Go and Rust - they're success is attributed in part to the fact that big companies are pushing them and using them.</p>
<p>Maybe the question:<br>
 "How do we foster greater adoption of Haskell?" </p>
<p>Is closely related to the question:<br>
"What are the major blockers with getting Haskell software into production?"</p>
<p>My line of thought is - at the end of the day, it doesn't matter if people like a language or not. Businesses want to make money, and you're going to use the language they tell you to use. </p>
<p>If Haskell provided enough value, businesses would be all over it, and adoption grows due to necessity. I believe business adoption is key to language adoption. Anyways! That's enough out of me! Just my 2¢</p>
<p>One more question that might be helpful: "What would have helped James successfully beat his co-worker in creating that service in Haskell?"</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/31b0847ae161d8af30e1a2fcb059be4d?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Hazem</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195308398" name="195308398"><div>2020-04-25 23:52:05</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>Great points <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="264632">@Vance Palacio</span> . A great example to support the point about business:<br>
Apple made Swift de facto mainstream by making it the official language for the Apple ecosystem, which itself is popular/mainstream.</p>
<p>Swift has a bunch of functional features but doesn't seem to advertise that heavily. It's almost certain that Swift as a language would not have gone mainstream without Apple's patronage.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that that a large company that owns a popular platform would adopt Haskell, but I think we can still make it compelling for a large number of users in the industry. I know this sounds overly optimistic but this is for an upcoming discussion.</p>
<p>As for the last question, I think there also is a chicken and egg problem involved (to some extent).<br>
more adoption = more libraries, or more libraries = more adoption</p>
<p>Ruby had a library that did 80% of the work in that example, and this seemed to be a major factor in the final outcome. </p>
<p>Regardless of the specifics of the situation James described, I'm willing to bet similar situations have occurred in other companies as well, and I agree it's really instructive to think about adoption from that perspective.</p>
<p>Thanks again. Today's discussions convinced me to take this topic more seriously and to look further into it.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/13896/4429aa8b689608f24a4ad712843ce29862e330d2?x=x&amp;version=2"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Sridhar Ratnakumar</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195345796" name="195345796"><div>2020-04-26 18:08:19</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>Somewhat related: there are successful indie products written in Haskell.

<p>If you read articles, books, or questions in any main stream language, you will find discussions about microservices, SOAP vs RESTful, NoSQL, bigdata, cloud...etc whatever technology  occupy the field at specific time, while Haskell community -according to my very little search- barely discuss these topics which makes it look as an alien to the software community.</p>
<p>I might be wrong, but functional programming communities in general and Haskell in specific focuses on the language features and correctness more than software engineering and system solutions so they don't show on business radars that much.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/31b0847ae161d8af30e1a2fcb059be4d?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Hazem</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195433914" name="195433914"><div>2020-04-27 15:28:31</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>ooh I never knew BazQux was written in Haskell!</p>
<p><em>"I'd imagine that Haskell helps the author to deliver in time and maintain the app with greater reliability ."</em></p>
<p>This is the kind of thing outsiders should be hearing about Haskell. I think many may take it with a grain of salt until provided with compelling evidence that it is possible + worth the effort. I'm not sure what that sort of evidence should look like. Definitely worth thinking about.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="294473">@Ahmad Abdelwahed</span> I think a major part of this issue is related to outsider awareness. Since Haskell is somewhat niche in the industry, many decision makers in business simply don't know much about what it can offer in practical terms, especially in the long run.  I suspect Haskell gets rapidly dismissed in those settings (or never even considered in the first place), and this is one of the major adoption bottlenecks we should be addressing. The benefits are clear to Haskellers, but not to outsiders. The delta is awareness/education IMO.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/13896/4429aa8b689608f24a4ad712843ce29862e330d2?x=x&amp;version=2"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Sridhar Ratnakumar</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195438284" name="195438284"><div>2020-04-27 16:02:47</div></a></div><div class="text"><p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="268567">@Hazem</span> Perhaps someone can encourage the author of BazQux to give talks, and write blog posts, on how Haskell particularly benefited his solo entrepreneurship.

<p>Look at the case of Rust - I would say it's one of the few languages with FP origins that's getting a really good traction recently. It has a long way to go, but big business are starting to slowly depend on it in critical infrastructure. But notice one thing: it mostly sells itself on one specific thing - prohibiting memory-related bugs, ones that are filling CVE database and make headlines for exposing serious vulnerabilities. That's something concrete, something business people can see by themselves, something you can measure, something you can point to in C++/C code and say "this wouldn't happen in Rust". I think we're often much less concrete when presenting e.g. Haskell itself - at the end, other languages have type systems and first-class functions too, we someone have to get through that they're _different_ there.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d3d2de116df80bc024b799e84dcdbc97?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">gilmi</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195471569" name="195471569"><div>2020-04-27 20:33:46</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>Memory-related issues are just too big to ignore.

Wild speculation below. You will probably change my mind</em></p>
<p>Re: UX for engineers <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="251120">@Sandy Maguire</span> </p>
<p>I think those pain points are definitely worth fixing. Haskell should be much less painful to work with. No question about that.</p>
<p>During our last video chat we discussed this in the context of increasing adoption, and the question was:</p>
<p>If Haskell suddenly had great UX for programmers, will that significantly increase adoption?<br>
(great UX in this case was referring to tooling and libraries)</p>
<p>and my wild guess is: Probably not. The biggest barrier to adoption is elsewhere.</p>
<p>I imagine the journey of someone assessing whether to adopt Haskell somewhat follows this order:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Awareness of pain points / bad ideas  in mainstream languages/paradigms</li>
<li>Awareness of the FP paradigm / Haskell and its benefits</li>
<li>Learning FP -&gt; Learning Haskell</li>
<li>Using Haskell to build something</li>
<li>Maintaining something built in Haskell<br>
...</li>
</ol>
<p>My guess is that the Haskell adoption bottleneck for MOST developers in the industry happens around stage 1 (or 0 if I have no faith in humanity)</p>
<p>I'm also guessing that a sizable majority of those who make it through stage 1 abandon Haskell in stage 2 (I'm an example of that, but I repented :P)</p>
<p>Past this point, I think a lot of people get hooked on Haskell (not necessarily for practical use), and this group will be served greatly by improving the daily pain points of dealing with Haskell (i.e. better tooling etc). Some people quit Haskell due to those UX issues, but I doubt it's a majority. Once someone understands the benefits of Haskell, it's hard to let go.</p>
<p>So I think great UX wont necessarily improve Haskell adoption in a noticeable way. We should absolutely fix those issues ASAP, but for different reasons. (Again, by UX I'm specifically referring to tooling and libraries)</p>
<p>Awareness about Haskell and its benefits is probably way lower than it should be. Furthermore, Haskell is uniquely difficult to learn (compared to mainstream languages). The adoption bottlenecks for most developers are probably at those stages.</p>
<p>So based on the above speculation, I'm proposing that:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Haskell gets great tooling, it might increase adoption a bit.</li>
<li>If Haskell gets <strong>great</strong> learning resources and provides clear claims about its benefits, it might bring Haskell much closer to mainstream adoption. (a lot of emphasis on <strong>great</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="225127">@TheMatten</span> pointed out something really important in the Rust example. You can sell the <strong>benefits</strong> of using the language in one sentence. The sentence is educational in nature:<br>
Memory safety is a major problem, and Rust solves this issue without sacrificing performance.</p>
<p>I realized I am not a representative sample, but this is how I got into Rust: I was a noob who didn't know why memory safety was a big deal. Someone told me having memory safety was a major benefit. I opened the Rust website and found the official Rust book. 20 minutes of reading later, I was sold on learning the language. The benefits were already clear to me. A few weeks later, I was going through a second book already.</p>
<p>I had a somewhat similar experience with Racket. I read somewhere about the benefits of language-oriented programming, and I found the book Beautiful Racket via the Racket website. The book explained the benefits of this paradigm, with clear examples, and I was sold on learning it.</p>
<p>My experience in Haskell has not been similar, sadly. The main thing that kept me here is my prior conviction that FP is really worth using, along with realizing that I need a powerful type system. It took me a while to understand the <strong>benefits</strong> of using Haskell. It might be an issue with how I think, but I'm guessing my experience might be generalize-able.</p>
<p>We can try to sell Haskell in one sentence. The official Haskell website has this at the top:</p>
<p><em>"Declarative, statically typed code."</em></p>
<p>The implications of this setence will not be understood by a large number of developers (the majority, I'd bet). The benefits are not clear without prior knowledge about these topics.</p>
<p>The website then lists these headings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Statically Typed</li>
<li>Purely functional</li>
<li>Type inference</li>
<li>Concurrent</li>
<li>Lazy</li>
<li>Packages (active open source contribution)</li>
</ul>
<p>I can group them up to form a sentence:</p>
<p><em>"Haskell is a statically-typed, purely-functional, lazy-evaluated, concurrent programming language with powerful type inference and an active open source package ecosystem."</em></p>
<p>and again I'm willing to bet a lot of developers wont really get the implications of this statement. The features are listed, and the <strong>benefits</strong> are implied only to those with prior knowledge of these topics.</p>
<p>I think the selling point should be through emphasizing the <strong>benefits</strong> of these features. To be fair, the benefits are somewhat explained below each heading, but I think they should be the main attraction; They should be clarified in one sentence.</p>
<p>I really like how Rust does it. This is from the official website:<br>
<em>"A language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software."</em></p>
<p>This is explaining the benefits, without listing any features. Below that, there are these headings:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span>Why Rust?
- performance
- reliability
- productivity
</pre></div>


<p>and this is followed by more info on why Rust is practical and how it's being used in production.</p>
<p>The features are listed throughout the homepage, but mainly in the context of explaining the benefits.</p>
<p>Contrast the Rust homepage to Haskell's homepage. There is no attempt to explain that Haskell is in fact used successfully in production at Microsoft and Facebook, for example.</p>
<p>In my opinion, we can focus on summarizing the benefits of Haskell when talking about the language. It would be cool if the homepage explained it like so:</p>
<p>"Haskell lets you build maintainable high-performance applications with much less code and much less bugs than mainstream languages."</p>
<p>If we had GREAT learning resources, we can add this to the homepage:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is it true that Haskell is difficult to learn?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This used to be the case, but we solved it. It is true that programming in Haskell is done differently from mainstream languages, so it requires some learning. Luckily, we have an excellent selection of resources to teach you how to use Haskell. They will teach you Haskell from scratch by guiding you, step-by-step, through building practical projects and libraries, and show you the skills you need to use Haskell in production.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So this is why I think we should prioritize raising awareness about the benefits of Haskell + providing GREAT learning material as a way to increase adoption. </p>
<p>My experience with Haskell books has been really sub-optimal, and that was after reading multiple books on FP first. It must be much harder for developers who are not even familiar with the FP paradigm.</p>
<p>I started this discussion to share my wild speculation on the matter. I realize I'm probably wrong, but if Haskell education really has a chance of removing a major adoption bottleneck, I'm very likely to commit to working on this issue for the upcoming 6~12 months. I have a lot of free time on my hands and this would be a worthy pursuit if it has a really good chance of being effective. I'm already drafting a concrete plan, but discussing it in text form will be too lengthy. @anyone please feel free to DM me if you want to chat about specific details.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot and sorry for the long post. I'm just really interested in figuring this out.</p>
<p>EDIT: I picked the wrong primary sentence from the Haskell homepage. The primary one below the logo is: <br>
<em>"An advanced, purely functional programming language"</em><br>
Which again is a statement about features rather than benefits.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bec451bb86edf3b69135abaca2641072?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Vance Palacio</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195497598" name="195497598"><div>2020-04-28 03:07:54</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>Just to chime in further, theres been many different reasons stated for why Haskell hasn't seen as much success as it should - I feel like there's sort of a greater theme emerging here in a sense.</p>

<p>I think all of these attributes combine to make Haskell feel like beta software. The overall quality of Haskell isn't inspiring confidence among business owners and engineers. No one wants to invest in a painfully difficult language with no blatently clear benefits just to see it disappear.<br>

<p>I know it's probably not the most clear cut solution, but it seems to me that we really need to ban together as a community to attack all of these pain points.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="251311">@Sridhar Ratnakumar</span> I personally prefer participating on Zulip but I think it's good for the topic to be discussed everywhere. As for submitting a PR to update the website, I think it's too early. It will probably backfire to strongly advertise the promised benefits of Haskell on the homepage without supporting these claims with practical educational resources that clearly demonstrate (to newcomers) those benefits in the context of production-ready applications.</p>
<p>What we should avoid is making promises that seem too good to be true, then ending up with frustrated newcomers who didn't find great resources to see those benefits in action. This will really hurt adoption.</p>
<p>I will submit a PR once such learning resources are available.

<p>This. I think there's too much hype and the learning resources we currently have usually don't get to the point quickly if at all.<br>

<p>The first time I was asked to prototype and jump start a greenfield project. The project was a system to manage custom forms and workflows used in food and drug manufacturing: software regulated by the FDA Part 11 in the US and ISO (I think? I can't remember exactly) Annex 14 in EU. I felt like prototyping in Haskell to work out some ideas I had around FRP and event sourcing. When I was discussing my results with a senior colleague they asked, "Why not just do the project in Haskell?"</p>
<p>So I made the case to the business stakeholders and they agreed. I hired a colleague from outside the company with experience writing serious amounts of Haskell to help me teach engineers and get the project off the ground. I put out a fairly popular job ad on reddit and elsewhere. I spoke at a local university about our use of Haskell. I started building a team.</p>
<p>However early on before all of that got off the ground there was another engineer at our company who was dubious of my choice to use Haskell for the project. He felt that I wasn't experienced enough with it, that nobody else at the company knew Haskell, that it would be hard to hire for... that it was too risky. I should choose a stack that is more tried and true.</p>
<p>A few months into the project and for many reasons there were plenty of roadblocks in my way. The business owners changed their minds about allowing me to hire remotely. We were given an arbitrary deadline and were asking for more time on our roadmap. We spent a little too much of the novelty budget and tried to implement a GraphQL API and were grinding our wheels on getting it to work well. We were making good progress but people were worried we weren't going fast enough.</p>
<p>Our unimpressed engineer, with the best of intentions and watching from the sidelines, heroically spent their free time implementing their own solution in Rails. I felt like I couldn't keep it from the light of day so we met with the stakeholders and his project was chosen to go ahead and mine was put in the ground. I had to fire my colleagues, turn down someone whom I was about to send an offer to, and archive all that work.</p>
<p>Undeterred I found another opportunity for a project where I felt like Haskell was a good fit. We have a size-able document database with entirely schema-less data from our applications. The applications have been around for almost a decade and have changed the format over time as errors were found, features added, and features removed. Unsurprisingly our customers, as we grew, were requesting access to this data to integrate it with their other software systems. This is the project I've been working on to this day.</p>
<p>I started by writing code that would safely parse this unstructured data and format it into a consistently structured format. I had started parsing these documents using Haskell as a side project for another idea I had so when this project came along I conveniently had enough code to carry it forward. With the help of Sandy we wrote a nice library to help with migrating types and I put it through the ringer on this project. It's good stuff.</p>
<p>Learning from my mistake in the past I decided to grow the team that would support this code internally. I started a group to teach Haskell from the first project and carried that onward. I taught a more structured course, invited more people to join, and started doing talks in the local developer community.</p>
<p>While this project was wildly successful in my opinion it failed in one key way: I'm still the only Haskell developer at our company. Interest and attendance in my Haskell learning group has dwindled and died out. I'm in the process of ensuring it is well-documented in the case where I'll be asked to port it/rewrite it in another language.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="251120">@Sandy Maguire</span> mentioned that we need to get founders and first engineers to choose Haskell. In my experience so far it is quite difficult to convince an existing software team to choose Haskell. Network effects and switching costs being what they are I think it's quite rare for a company to move to a new language and ecosystem and they tend to stick with what they know. I agree that we need companies to choose Haskell from the beginning.</p>
<p>Tools and developer experience are great but the reason why many language ecosystems have better ones than Haskell is because companies like Microsoft, Oracle, and Google can spend hundreds of millions of dollars employing teams of experienced, full-time developers to build the best DX. For them it's a platform game. We can and do provide a rather decent set of tools: the language itself is really damn good and while learning it was hard I'm convinced it's the best language and ecosystem I've experienced in a long time.</p>
<p>But I don't think Haskell jobs are going to start appearing unless we start Haskell companies and hire developers and teach them Haskell.</p>
<p>The other approach is the killer app approach... but I don't think you can plan for that one. Rails is what made Ruby popular over night. However it wasn't because Rails was special: there were numerous such frameworks in more popular languages at the time. There is some amount of luck involved: early adopters that are socially influential, features in the framework that make it attractive in the context of competition, people just being tired of the same old and wanting to try something novel and new. You can't really start a project and say, "Okay this is going to be our killer app that will break Haskell into the industry!" They didn't start Rails that way.</p>
<p>Otherwise you need a war chest. Metric tonnes of cash to market and seduce developers into choosing Haskell.  This is what Oracle did in the mid-90s. 500M or so? It was unheard of. But it was <em>everywhere</em>. Spend enough money and you can make Haskell appear like the next big thing.</p>
<p>The cheapest option, I think, is to start a company. Choose to use Haskell. Write about it. Talk about it. And if enough companies choose Haskell and someone makes it and gets big then we'll start to see bumps in adoption, more jobs, and more engineers trying to convince their teams to adopt it.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ba4faf2fc5818d37c0aed6acb5b69a2?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">James King</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195615794" name="195615794"><div>2020-04-28 19:43:31</div></a></div><div class="text"><p><em>Growing a Community</em> is definitely something I think we do well on.

If getting started with and learning Haskell was easier, you might not have needed to invest as much in training others, and might make it easier to convince skeptics.</p>
<p>I think that if "hire a new competent developer, buy them a book about Haskell, give them a couple of weeks and expect them to be able to get into and start maintaining a moderately sized somewhat well documented project" story doesn't sound like a realistic scenario, we have a problem.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ba4faf2fc5818d37c0aed6acb5b69a2?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">James King</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195646615" name="195646615"><div>2020-04-29 00:38:14</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>If there is a blessed path it might help.

<p>I think if you have an established project with an experienced lead it is straight forward to incorporate less-experienced developers new to Haskell. A code style guide, hlint, continuous integration, and code review go a long way to keeping the code base safe and healthy.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3d24a4100b3eab34d8ce3059d789c543?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Sandy Maguire</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195646633" name="195646633"><div>2020-04-29 00:38:54</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>this, i think ^</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3d24a4100b3eab34d8ce3059d789c543?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Sandy Maguire</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195646655" name="195646655"><div>2020-04-29 00:39:21</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>i have found teams can get new people up to speed _very quickly_ if you have a strong lead who has time to teach</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3d24a4100b3eab34d8ce3059d789c543?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Sandy Maguire</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195646672" name="195646672"><div>2020-04-29 00:39:54</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>a big chunk of why learning hs is hard is that there aren't a lot of great options for quickly asking "i'm stuck on this super small problem, help"</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bec451bb86edf3b69135abaca2641072?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Vance Palacio</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195647597" name="195647597"><div>2020-04-29 00:52:49</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>I have a couple of "learning article" types of things on Haskell/purescript in a <em>gasp</em> private repo on gitlab.

I think people that are not that confident in the language feel a lot more comfortable going into an online meeting than into an actual meetup<br>
For me it was the case, and I think that welcoming new people through online "events" or meetings takes a lot of the anxieties away as one might have discomfort engaging a, to them completely, unknown group. And of course the detachment from location makes it a lot easier for everyone to engage with the community</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/31b0847ae161d8af30e1a2fcb059be4d?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Hazem</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#195856483" name="195856483"><div>2020-04-30 15:29:38</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>Serokell recently posted a great article relevant to this discussion:<br>

<p>The question then becomes how do we address people's limiting beliefs of Haskell?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the solution is to show outsiders how practical things get done in the subset of Haskell required for practical tasks, and avoiding upfront discussions about the not-strictly-necessary fancy stuff in Haskell.</p>
<p>Perhaps in a similar fashion to how the creator of Rails demonstrated it here:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzj723LkRJY">YouTube - Ruby on Rails demo</a></p>
<p>Rails can be used for many things, but the author showed a simple practical task: creating a basic blog engine in 15 minutes. </p>
<p>Comparing a framework demo (blog engine in Rails) to a language demo (Haskell) is not exactly right, I know. But back when Rails was new, I imagine it was great to have demos like that, so you can quickly point to them if you wanted to convince someone to give Rails a try. I'm also willing to bet a lot of people got into Ruby after learning about Rails, through demos like that.</p>
<p>I'm specifically referring to the aspect of <strong>quick demonstration/proof of practical utility</strong>. If we have a bunch of 15..30 minute presentations about Haskell, with this goal in mind, it would help a lot. </p>
<p>Personally I'd focus on these 3 goals to help with adoption / addressing limiting beliefs of Haskell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Making demos / learning material as described above</li>
<li>Improving the docs, especially for commonly used things</li>
<li>Improving the Haskell homepage to emphasize the benefits of Haskell (as discussed before), but only after #1 and #2 are completed, and not before then.</li>
</ol>

Functional Programming (FP) is an emerging mainstream in the software development world. However, the success of FP has come not from programming languages, but frameworks. React - the dominant framework for building web apps today - emphasizes immutability and composing smaller functional components to build a UI. Spark emphasizes immutable data transformations and treats functions as first-class concepts (e.g., UDFs). In machine learning, research is moving towards higher-order derivatives with functional programming - such as Google JAX - because the defaults for FP are more flexible and expressive.

There are many more examples that you have likely encountered in some form. And while this could be seen as cause for celebration, something is off. Haskell, Scala, F#, OCAML, Clojure, and other beloved programming languages are still seen as niche in working environments. You can utilize functional programming concepts in your daily work, but not always in a functional language. There is no shortage of fascinating and useful concepts, libraries, and tools that occupy these languages' ecosystems, but they have all seen little adoption in the broader programming community.

This talk will cover the framing that was previously mentioned and offer hypotheses about how FP languages can rise in adoption without abandoning all the things that make them so great. Topics discussed include editor tooling, debuggers, profiling and analysis tools, scripting and visualization, library design, and library ecosystem focus. Every FP language has strengths in some areas over others, but all have objective deficiencies when compared to mainstream programming languages like Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, and so on. But not all is lost! There are some novel concepts, libraries, and tools in FP language ecosystems that could propel the use of FP languages if some deficiencies are addressed. This is the central proposition of this talk.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/13896/4429aa8b689608f24a4ad712843ce29862e330d2?x=x&amp;version=2"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Sridhar Ratnakumar</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#200307083" name="200307083"><div>2020-06-10 00:16:02</div></a></div><div class="text"><blockquote>

<p>I'm planning to do something similar in the future. Partly due to the the issue you mentioned, I plan to avoid the live streaming format. Instead, I'll hopefully follow a format similar to the one in <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts</a></p>
<p>I'll probably do what he did: no comment section, no live streams. For feedback, contacting the author directly is the best approach.

<p>I use the word "[false] belief". Basically conceptions that are not factual. And they are very common in the wild out there, about Haskell. My stance is that as long as these false beliefs remain widespread, Haskell will remain a niche.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/13896/7334dc60b6aef6a75cd9284126231f13c76926a5?x=x&amp;version=4"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Torsten Schmits</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#210639952" name="210639952"><div>2020-09-19 23:17:24</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>then it seems to me that in order to elucidate this false belief, you would have to prove the numbers of projects in relation to the magnitudes of the communities, given that they are talking about "productivity"</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/49728c9821ae019b34ffedde4f758018?d=identicon&amp;version=1"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">tristanC</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#210639998" name="210639998"><div>2020-09-19 23:18:45</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>I wonder how do you approximate productivity by looking at what is produced.

<p>The retort was "Maybe you’re an exception". I'd think that this disbelief arises from that person's false belief about Haskell's worth/usefulness; they don't say it upfront, and instead tries to buttress their disbelief by going on a tangent about programming language popularity (nevermind that popularity is nothing to do with productivity), via their somewhat-affective allusion to "looking at what’s produced by each community" - but this is a different "production" which is more a factor of popularity than language producvity (the latter is what my comment, as well as the parent comment, was talking about).</p>
<p>You can't compare a community with 1000 Go programmers, and another community with 30 Haskell programmers, and then conclude that the former is more "productive".</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/13896/4429aa8b689608f24a4ad712843ce29862e330d2?x=x&amp;version=2"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Sridhar Ratnakumar</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#210642190" name="210642190"><div>2020-09-20 00:32:38</div></a></div><div class="text"><hr>
<p>And when measuring productivity, you must do that at all stages of the project. Not just initial "monkey coding" phase of churning out cool features. But also during middle phase of adding features or changes without breaking the then significantly grown existing code, as well as the later maintenance phase. I wouldn't be surprised if the likes of Go do well in the initial phases, but not as much in later phases. (Python would be even worse)</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/13896/4429aa8b689608f24a4ad712843ce29862e330d2?x=x&amp;version=2"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Sridhar Ratnakumar</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#210645057" name="210645057"><div>2020-09-20 02:13:20</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>Some Haskell companies -- like Obsidian in this screenshot -- openly claim that Haskell is an essential ingredient in their productivity (compared to competitors). </p>

I used it in a project, but recently went back to the standard prelude. I had a few reasons for doing this:</p>
<ol>
<li>I can paste code for others and not have to explain that it's using <code>relude</code>,</li>
<li>I can pull out a section of code and make it into a standalone library that doesn't depend on <code>relude</code>,</li>
<li>I can keep my intuition for which things I need to import for certain functions. This is useful for when I work on projects that don't use <code>relude</code>, or when I read others' code.</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically it comes down to standardisation. Often its better to do things the best way (e.g. use <code>relude</code>), but there are drawbacks if the best way isn't the standard way. As Haskellers I think we are inclined to do things the best way rather than the standard way (otherwise we would be javascripters), but if we spend all our time reinventing the best possible wheel then we may never get that car built.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/13896/83d70d23ca1b42464032f434141b1503a290a7ec?x=x&amp;version=2"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Steven Shaw</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#210694644" name="210694644"><div>2020-09-21 01:28:46</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>Those are valid reasons, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="282523">@Alex Chapman</span> .

A lot of the Haskell community is really enthusiastic about the language and that actually scares beginners.</p>
<p>The few people I've helped learn Haskell often have simple questions, but most of the answers they come across don't answer them simply. For example, I really struggled to just use the do notation because every time I read into it, the topic quickly  jumped into how to desugar it and the implications of that.  Then I finally worked with it enough to realize that the desugarring rarely matters, and mostly I shouldn't worry too much about it . I should just use it.</p>
<p>I found this a repeating pattern. I struggled with it, and a couple friends that ventured to learn Haskell ran into the same problem on various topics. Most people give up if they feel like they have to understand the language that deeply, and I don't think they need to.</p>
<p>Take JavaScript and the weird <code>this</code> semantics as an example. It can have really bad implications, but most of the JS devs I worked with don't bother to understand it because it only comes up a couple times a year, and they can google for a straight forward solution. I think a lot of the Haskell nitty gritty details fall in the same category. Now you might argue that this lack of understanding is a bad thing, but I would argue that being able to get work done without the deep understanding is what makes a language accessible.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/13896/4429aa8b689608f24a4ad712843ce29862e330d2?x=x&amp;version=2"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Sridhar Ratnakumar</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#211683738" name="211683738"><div>2020-09-29 21:02:45</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>(Thread on CLI detached to <a href="#narrow/stream/201385-Haskell/topic/Growing.20the.20Haskell.20Community.20via.20CLI.20utilities">here</a>)</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/13896/4429aa8b689608f24a4ad712843ce29862e330d2?x=x&amp;version=2"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Sridhar Ratnakumar</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#212370749" name="212370749"><div>2020-10-05 23:55:51</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>I think I see another reason why Haskell is not popular for app development.

<li>do you avoid generic-lens<ul>
<li>yes and no. I use generic-lenses in some implementations, but I hide them behind another interface. It's a black box at that point</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>and mkLenses<ul>
<li>Yes. Definitely. I won't use them. I won't let code reviews pass that use them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>aesons Generic<ul>
<li>yes and no. I default to using the generic instances, but as soon as the <em>default</em> generics don't do what I want, I write the instances manually. This might include aeson-casing and generics still though. I do try to write the <code>tripping</code> tests + golden tests for each to make sure the instances are backwards compatible</li>

<p>matter of "correctness"</p>

<p>yes. I try to not trust generics on this, unless you're on the happy path and the defaults work out of the box. As soon as you for example require modifying the field names in aeson, the "correctness" provided by generics is thrown out of the window.<br>
I try to write even more boilerplate by writing tests for each and every aeson instance for example.</p></div></div></div><div class="comment"><a class="avatar"><img src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/13896/67dba8dccee74946586f0fa81945a7ce22dc273b?x=x&amp;version=2"></a><div class="content"><a class="author">Mats Rauhala</a><div class="metadata"><a href="#212397389" name="212397389"><div>2020-10-06 08:22:00</div></a></div><div class="text"><p>I'm much more apprehensive of template haskell as it's too opaque.</p>
